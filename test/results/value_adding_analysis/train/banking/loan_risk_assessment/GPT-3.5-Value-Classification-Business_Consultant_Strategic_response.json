Context is crucial: A step's classification may depend on its position in the overall process. \n       What seems non-value adding in isolation might be necessary when considering the bigger picture.\n\n    2. Customer perspective: Always try to view the process from the customer's point of view. \n       What they perceive as valuable should guide your VA classifications.\n\n    3. Industry standards: Some steps might be BVA due to industry regulations or standards, \n       even if they don't directly add value for the customer.\n\n    4. Potential for improvement: When classifying NVA steps, consider if they could be eliminated \n       or combined with other steps to improve efficiency.\n\n    5. Consistency: Ensure similar steps across different activities are classified consistently \n       unless there's a clear reason for differentiation.\n    ",
