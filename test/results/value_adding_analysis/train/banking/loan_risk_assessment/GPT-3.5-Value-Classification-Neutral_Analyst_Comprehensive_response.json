Identify value: Classify as VA only those steps that directly contribute to what the customer \n       is willing to pay for.\n\n    2. Map the value stream: Consider how each step fits into the overall flow of value creation. \n       Some BVA steps might be crucial for enabling VA steps.\n\n    3. Create flow: Steps that cause delays or interruptions in the process flow should be \n       scrutinized and potentially classified as NVA.\n\n    4. Establish pull: Steps that are performed \"just-in-time\" based on actual demand tend to be \n       more value-adding than those done in anticipation of demand.\n\n    5. Seek perfection: Always consider if there's a way to convert BVA or NVA steps into VA steps, \n       or to eliminate NVA steps entirely.\n\n    6. Respect for people: Remember that some steps might seem NVA but are crucial for employee \n       well-being or safety, which indirectly benefits the customer through better service.\n    ",
