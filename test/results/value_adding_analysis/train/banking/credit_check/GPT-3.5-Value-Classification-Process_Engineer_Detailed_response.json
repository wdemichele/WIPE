            "task_description": "\n    Your task is to evaluate the efficiency of a business process by analyzing the given JSON-formatted BPMN \n    process output. Classify each step as value adding (VA), business value adding (BVA), or non-value adding (NVA), \n    with a focus on identifying potential areas for process improvement. For each step:\n    1. Assess its contribution to overall process efficiency.\n    2. Classify it based on its value contribution.\n    3. Provide a concise explanation for your classification, highlighting any efficiency considerations.\n    4.

Business Value Adding (BVA):\n       - Required by law, regulation, or company policy\n       - Reduces financial risk, supports financial reporting, or ensures security\n       - Necessary for business operations but not directly valued by the customer\n\n    3. Non-Value Adding (NVA):\n       - Consumes resources without adding value to the customer or business\n       - Includes waiting, rework, overprocessing, or unnecessary movement\n       - Can often be eliminated without impacting the quality of the product/service or business operations\n    ",

Context is crucial: A step's classification may depend on its position in the overall process. \n       What seems non-value adding in isolation might be necessary when considering the bigger picture.\n\n    2. Customer perspective: Always try to view the process from the customer's point of view. \n       What they perceive as valuable should guide your VA classifications.\n\n    3. Industry standards: Some steps might be BVA due to industry regulations or standards, \n       even if they don't directly add value for the customer.\n\n    4. Potential for improvement: When classifying NVA steps, consider if they could be eliminated \n       or combined with other steps to improve efficiency.\n\n    5. Consistency: Ensure similar steps across different activities are classified consistently \n       unless there's a clear reason for differentiation.\n    ",
