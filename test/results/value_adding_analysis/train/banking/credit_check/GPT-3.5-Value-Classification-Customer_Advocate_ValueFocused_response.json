Customer perspective: Always try to view the process from the customer's point of view. \n       What they perceive as valuable should guide your VA classifications.\n\n    3. Industry standards: Some steps might be BVA due to industry regulations or standards, \n       even if they don't directly add value for the customer.\n\n    4. Potential for improvement: When classifying NVA steps, consider if they could be eliminated \n       or combined with other steps to improve efficiency.\n\n    5.
