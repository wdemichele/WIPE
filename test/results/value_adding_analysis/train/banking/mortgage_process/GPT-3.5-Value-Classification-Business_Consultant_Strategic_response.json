            "task_description": "\n    Your task is to analyze the given JSON-formatted BPMN process output and classify each step as either \n    value adding (VA), business value adding (BVA), or non-value adding (NVA). For each step, you should:\n    1. Determine the appropriate classification based on the step's contribution to the process.\n    2. Provide a brief justification for your classification.\n    3.

Business Value Adding (BVA):\n       - Required by law, regulation, or company policy\n       - Reduces financial risk, supports financial reporting, or ensures security\n       - Necessary for business operations but not directly valued by the customer\n\n    3. Non-Value Adding (NVA):\n       - Consumes resources without adding value to the customer or business\n       - Includes waiting, rework, overprocessing, or unnecessary movement\n       - Can often be eliminated without impacting the quality of the product/service or business operations\n    ",

Create a classify() function call, ensuring the activity name and step description match the input exactly.\n    4.

Context is crucial: A step's classification may depend on its position in the overall process. \n       What seems non-value adding in isolation might be necessary when considering the bigger picture.\n\n    2. Customer perspective: Always try to view the process from the customer's point of view. \n       What they perceive as valuable should guide your VA classifications.\n\n    3. Industry standards: Some steps might be BVA due to industry regulations or standards, \n       even if they don't directly add value for the customer.\n\n    4. Potential for improvement: When classifying NVA steps, consider if they could be eliminated \n       or combined with other steps to improve efficiency.\n\n    5. Consistency: Ensure similar steps across different activities are classified consistently \n       unless there's a clear reason for differentiation.\n    ",
