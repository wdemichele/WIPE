    "task_description": "\n    Your task is to analyze the given JSON-formatted BPMN process output and classify each step as either \n    value adding (VA), business value adding (BVA), or non-value adding (NVA). For each step, you should:\n    1. Determine the appropriate classification based on the step's contribution to the process.\n    2. Provide a brief justification for your classification.\n    3. Format your response as a function call for each step, including the classification, activity name, \n       step name, and justification.\n    ",
    "classification_types": "\n    1. Value Adding (VA): Activities that directly contribute to meeting customer needs or requirements.\n    2. Business Value Adding (BVA): Activities that are necessary for the business but don't directly add value for the customer.\n    3. Non-Value Adding (NVA): Activities that neither contribute to customer requirements nor are necessary for business functions.\n    ",
    "function_definition": "\n    Use the following function to classify each step:\n\n    classify(classification, activity, step, justification)\n\n    Parameters:\n    - classification: The type of classification for the step (\"VA\", \"BVA\", or \"NVA\")\n    - activity: The name of the activity this step belongs to\n    - step: A short, descriptive name for the step\n    - justification: The reason for its classification\n    ",
    "parsing_instructions": "\n    To parse the input JSON and generate the appropriate function calls:\n\n    1. Read through the JSON input sequentially.\n    2. For each activity in the JSON:\n       a. Extract the activity name.\n       b. For each substep in the activity:\n          i. Extract the step description.\n          ii. Determine the appropriate classification (VA, BVA, or NVA).\n          iii. Formulate a brief justification for the classification.\n          iv. Create a classify() function call with these elements.\n    3. Ensure each function call is on a new line in your output.\n    ",
    "output_format": "\n    Format your output as a series of function calls, one per line. Each function call should follow this format:\n\n    classify(\"CLASSIFICATION\", \"Activity Name\", \"Step Description\", \"Justification for classification\")\n\n    Replace CLASSIFICATION with VA, BVA, or NVA as appropriate. Use the exact activity name and step description from the input JSON. Provide a brief justification for each classification.\n    ",
