      "\n",
      "2. **First Task**:\n",
      "   - Both diagrams have a task labeled \"Check Application Procedure\".\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **First Gateway (Exclusive Gateway)**:\n",

      "2. **Client Lane**:\n",

      "   - The decision to take a ticket is represented by an XOR gateway in both diagrams.\n",
      "   - The client waits for their turn, asks for a specific request, and checks the number of tickets ahead.\n",
      "   - The client collects their order if a new request is made.\n",
      "3. **Request Assistant Lane**:\n",
      "   - Both diagrams show the request assistant sending the order request document, registering the request, and considering if there are enough requests to respond to customer demand.\n",
      "   - The decision regarding sufficient requests is represented by an XOR gateway in both diagrams.\n",

      "1. **Start and End Events**:\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Initial Task**:\n",
      "   - Both diagrams have the initial task \"Record the data of each patient\".\n",

      "3. **Parallel Gateway**:\n",
      "   - Both diagrams use a parallel gateway to split the process into three parallel tasks:\n",
      "     - \"Register the SSN of the patient\"\n",
      "     - \"Register the Name of the patient\"\n",
      "     - \"Register the Surname of the patient\"\n",
      "   - These tasks are then synchronized back into a single flow using another parallel gateway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Subsequent Tasks**:\n",
      "   - Both diagrams continue with the task \"Print referral document\".\n",
      "   - Both diagrams then proceed to \"Archive the record in the file system\".\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Data Stores**:\n",
